# Precision Interventional Psychiatry: A Tripartite Model

This repository outlines a framework for personalized psychiatric care that bridges the gap between psychoanalysis, neuroscience, and computational intelligence.

## 🌟 The Vision
The model moves beyond "trial and error" psychiatry toward a **dynamically-modulated predictive care system**. By integrating **Active Inference** with **Digital Twin simulations**, we aim to map and treat the mind as a dynamic computational system.

## 🧩 The Tripartite Model
1. **Personalized Self-State Mapping:** Utilizing empirical psychoanalytic frameworks to define the "Internal World."
2. **Active Inference Therapy:** Grounded in the Free Energy Principle (FEP) to model patient state transitions.
3. **Experiential Field Theory & Digital Twins:** Using real-time monitoring and virtual modeling to guide interventional neuromodulation.

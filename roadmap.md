# Implementation Roadmap

## Phase 1: Digital Twin Formalization
* Standardizing "Self-State" variables for computational modeling.
* Establishing the feedback loop between physical sensors and virtual "Digital Twins."

## Phase 2: Agentic AI Coaching Integration
* Developing the "Agentic AI Coach" to provide real-time therapeutic guidance.
* Synchronization of patient and therapist biometric data streams.

## Phase 3: Closed-Loop Neuromodulation
* Translating "Predictive Session Simulations" into real-time control signals for neuromodulation devices.
